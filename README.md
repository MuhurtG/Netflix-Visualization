This is my first Data Analysis Project which gives me an overview about the technical world
In this project:-
We preprocess the given data at first, so that we dont find any kind of difficulty in analysing
At the end we get a visual data of :
    Movie release per year
    Movie release per month (across every year)
    Rolling trend
    Popularity of genre
    Most popular Movie
